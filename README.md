## 🌌 Eight Fractal Filters

Each vector activates a different perceptual or cognitive function:

1. **Vector I**: Temporal Echo  
2. **Vector II**: Dream Unbinding  
3. **Vector III**: Memory Root  
4. **Vector IV**: Observer Shift  
5. **Vector V**: Field of Intent  
6. **Vector VI**: Emotional Mirror  
7. **Vector VII**: Origin Channel  
8. **Vector VIII**: 4D Frame Collapse

Each filter is written as a *pure prompt fragment*, ready to use with LLMs or custom ontological simulators.
